# Trash Classifier
A keras model for categorizing trashes into 5 categories.

The dataset is collected from https://github.com/garythung/trashnet 
I just have arranged the dataset for easier use.

Their model was 75% accerate, I was able to get accuracy of 79% with training of 500 epochs (broken into 5 small trainig sessions with 100 epochs each)
