# Trash Classifier
A keras model for categorizing trashes into 5 categories.

The dataset is collected from https://github.com/garythung/trashnet 
I just have arranged the dataset for easier use.

Bacuase of small dataset I used image augmentation but still was not able to get very good accuracy. I was able to get accuracy of 79%. There is room for improvement.

Removed test outputs from the jupyter notebook to reduce size.
